== Fixed issues

The following issue has been resolved in the current release:

* {gitops-title} Operator v1.4.0 introduced a regression which removes the description fields from `spec` for the following CRDs:

** `argoproj.io_applications.yaml`
** `argoproj.io_appprojects.yaml`
** `argoproj.io_argocds.yaml`

Before this update, if you created an `AppProject` resource using the `kubectl create`, it failed to synchronize. This update restores the missing description fields in `CustomResourceDefinitions: ArgoCD, AppProject, Application` that caused `kubectl create` to fail. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/GITOPS-1721[GITOPS-1721]
