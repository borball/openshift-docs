[id="migration-compatibility-guidelines_{context}"]
= Compatibility guidelines

You must install the {mtc-full} ({mtc-short}) Operator that is compatible with your {product-title} version.

You cannot install {mtc-short} {mtc-version} on {product-title} 4.5, or earlier versions, because the custom resource definition API versions are incompatible.

You can migrate workloads from a source cluster with {mtc-short} {mtc-legacy-version-z} to a target cluster with {mtc-short} {mtc-version} as long as the `MigrationController` custom resource and the {mtc-short} web console are running on the target cluster.
